- Gordon parcellation (because of course of development)
- Better parcellation than others?
- Look up: paper on reinforcement learning in mania (increased reward
  sensitivity in acute mania)

** How does it relate to psychosis and cognition?
- Same network architecture in sz?
- Basic network organization looks similar in cortical networks
- What about the magnitude of the relationship of subnetworks?
- Relevant for cognitive function: frontoparietal (goal-represnation,
  task-control), cingulo-opercular (task control; conflict processing);
  default network (attending to internal states; needs to shut off
  during tasks)

* Graph theory
- Efficiency: easy of information flow in a network; high efficiency is
  shorter path length
- Hub behavior: how connected is a region?
- Participation coefficient: how many subnetworks is a node connected with?

* Global efficiency and cognition
- Sheffield paper 2017, JAM psych: cognitive efficiency transdiagnostically 
- What does it represent biologically? Is it reflecting disrupted development
of white matter connections? DTI studies need to show this.

* Cingulo-Opercular network global efficiency
- Seems to be important in schizophrenia and cognition
